generate_valid_structure([list of rules which must be true], Structure)


A structure must contain ...

at least 3 red pieces
at_least(red, 3, Structure)

at least 2 blue pyramid pieces
at_least(blue, pyramid, 2, Structure) --> Ordering of attr irrelevant

exactly 1 flat piece
exactly(flat, 1, Structure)

more pyramid pieces than red pieces
more_than(pyramid, red, Structure)  --> Ordering important!

an even/odd number of total pieces
even_number_of(Structure)

an even/odd number of red pieces
odd_number_of(red, Structure)

either 2 or 3 total pieces
either_or(2, 3, Structure)

at least 1 red piece and/or exactly 2 blue pieces
and([at_least(red, 1, Structure), exactly(blue, 2, Structure)])


Interaction:
exactly 2 red pieces touching another pyramid piece
exactly_interaction(red, pyramid, touching, 2, Structure)
